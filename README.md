# Github-repository-retriever

This is the Github Repository Readme Retriever Microproject I attempted for the TAIGER Front-end internship position.

## Setting up and running the project locally

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev
```

## Disclaimer:
Due to the possibly high rate of Github API calls, I had to use dummy data in order to test the display.
